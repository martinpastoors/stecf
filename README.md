Codes developed during STECF meeting 2015

The codes and data were developed in the STECF plenary 3 to assist in the calculations of potential TAC topups to be applied in the context of the EU landing obligation. The data consists of CSV files derived from the FDI database and an excel spreadsheet based on the member state declarations on the applicability of the landing obligation to specific fisheries.
